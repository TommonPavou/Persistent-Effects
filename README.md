## Description:
Persistent Effects is a server-side mod designed to enhance gameplay and convenience. It ensures that players retain their active status effects even after death, eliminating the frustration of losing buffs or debuffs upon respawning. By preserving effects and reapplying them automatically, this mod not only improves the player experience but also maintains fairness in multiplayer environments, as it prevents players from removing effects by dying.

Key Features:

  - Keep's the players effects even after death.

  - Preserves the type, level, and remaining duration of each effect.

  - Fully compatible with vanilla effects.

Whether you're running a small private server or a large multiplayer world, Persistent Effects helps streamline gameplay while maintaining balance and fairness.

Full compatibility with mods that introduce others potion effects is not guaranteed.

I will soon release this mod for additional Minecraft versions. To stay up to date for future updates and releases, consider following this mod!
